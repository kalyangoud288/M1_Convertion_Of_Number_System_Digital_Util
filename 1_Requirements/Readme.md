# Requirements
## Introduction
There are different types of Number systems

1.	Binaryary Number System
2.	Decimalimal Number System
3.	Octalal Number System
4.	Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal Number System

We have four types of number systems so each one can be converted into the remaining three systems. There are the following conversions possible in Number System
1.	Binaryary  To Other Number System
2.	Decimalimal To Other Number System
3.	Octalal To Other Number System
4.	Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal To Other Number System

i) BinaryARY TO OTHER NUMBER SYSTEMS:
•	Binaryary To Decimalimal Number System
•	Binaryary To Octalal Number System
•	Binaryary To Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal Number System

ii) DecimalIMAL TO OTHER NUMBER SYSTEMS:
•	Decimalimal to Binaryary Number System
•	Decimalimal to Octalal Number Systems
•	Decimalimal to Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal Number System

iii) OctalAL TO OTHER NUMBER SYSTEMS:
•	Octalal to Binaryary Number System
•	Octalal to Decimalimal Number System
•	Octalal to Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal Number System

iv) Hexa-DecimalA DecimalIMAL NUMBER SYSTEMS:
•	Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal to Decimalimal Number System
•	Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal to Binaryary Number System
•	Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal to Octalal Number System
