## Introduction
There are different types of Nber systems

1.	Binaryary Nber System
2.	Decimalimal Nber System
3.	Octalal Nber System
4.	Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal Nber System

We have four types of Nber systems so each one can be converted in-- the remaining three systems. There are the following conversions possible in Nber System
1.	Binaryary  -- Other Nber System
2.	Decimalimal -- Other Nber System
3.	Octalal -- Other Nber System
4.	Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal -- Other Nber System

i) BinaryARY -- OTHER NBER SYSTEMS:
•	Binary -- Decimal Number System
•	Binary -- Octal Number System
•	Binary -- Hexa-Decimal Number System

ii) Decimal -- OTHER NUMBER SYSTEMS:
•	Decimal -- Binary Number System
•	Decimal  -- Octal Number Systems
•	Decimal -- Hexa-Decimal Decimal Number System

iii) Octal -- OTHER NBER SYSTEMS:
•	Octal -- Binary Number System
•	Octal -- Decimal Number System
•	Octal -- Hexa-Decimal  Number System

__Decimal -- Binary Conversion__
  1.Write the Number.
  2.Divide Number by 2 and write remainder.
  3.Divide the quotient obtained by 2 and  the remainder.
  5.Repeat the same process till we get 0 the quotient.
  6.Write values of all the remainders starting from the bot--m -- the --p.
  
__Decimal -- Octal Conversion__
  1.Write the given decimal number.
  2.If the given decimal number is less than 8 the octal number is the same.
  3.Else the decimal number is greater than 7 then divide the number by 8.The remainder, we get after division.
  4.Repeat step 3 and 4 with the quotient till it is less than 8.
  5.Write values from Bot--m -- --p

__Decimal -- Hexa Decimal__
  1.Divide the decimal number by 16. 
  2.Write down the remainder (in hexadecimal).
  3.Divide the result again by 16. 
  4.Repeat step 2 and 3 until result is 0.
  5.The hex value is the digit sequence of the remainders from the bot--m -- --p.

__Binary -- Decimal Conversion__
   1.Write down the binary number and list the powers of 2 from right -- left.
   2.Write the digits of the binary number below their corresponding powers of two.
   3.Connect the digits in the binary number with their corresponding powers of two.
   4.Write down the final value of each power of two.
   5.Add final values

__Binary -- Octal Conversion__
1.Write binary number.
2.Multiply each digit by 2n-1.
3.The resultant is the equivalent decimal number for the given binary number.
4.Divide the decimal number by 8.
5.note down the remainder.

__Binary -- Hexa Decimal__
1.Break  the binary number in-- group with 4 digits 
2.By looking at the conversion table, write the hexadecimal equivalent of each of the groups.
3.Combine all the numbers --gether -- get the hexadecimal number.
