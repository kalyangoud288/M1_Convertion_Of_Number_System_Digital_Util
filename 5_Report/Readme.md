## Introduction
There are different types of Nber systems

1.	Binaryary Nber System
2.	Decimalimal Nber System
3.	Octalal Nber System
4.	Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal Nber System

We have four types of Nber systems so each one can be converted into the remaining three systems. There are the following conversions possible in Nber System
1.	Binaryary  To Other Nber System
2.	Decimalimal To Other Nber System
3.	Octalal To Other Nber System
4.	Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal To Other Nber System

i) BinaryARY TO OTHER NBER SYSTEMS:
•	Binary To Decimal Number System
•	Binary To Octal Number System
•	Binary To Hexa-Decimal Number System

ii) Decimal TO OTHER NUMBER SYSTEMS:
•	Decimal to Binary Number System
•	Decimal  to Octal Number Systems
•	Decimal to Hexa-Decimal Decimal Number System

iii) Octal TO OTHER NBER SYSTEMS:
•	Octal to Binary Number System
•	Octal to Decimal Number System
•	Octal to Hexa-Decimal  Number System

__Decimal to Binary Conversion__
  1.Write the Number.
  2.Divide Number by 2 and write remainder.
  3.Divide the quotient obtained by 2 and  the remainder.
  5.Repeat the same process till we get 0 the quotient.
  6.Write values of all the remainders starting from the bottom to the top.
  
__Decimal to Octal Conversion__
  1.Write the given decimal number.
  2.If the given decimal number is less than 8 the octal number is the same.
  3.Else the decimal number is greater than 7 then divide the number by 8.The remainder, we get after division.
  4.Repeat step 3 and 4 with the quotient till it is less than 8.
  5.Write values from Bottom to top

__Decimal to Hexa Decimal__
  1.Divide the decimal number by 16. 
  2.Write down the remainder (in hexadecimal).
  3.Divide the result again by 16. 
  4.Repeat step 2 and 3 until result is 0.
  5.The hex value is the digit sequence of the remainders from the bottom to top.

__Binary to Decimal Conversion__
   1.Write down the binary number and list the powers of 2 from right to left.
   2.Write the digits of the binary number below their corresponding powers of two.
   3.Connect the digits in the binary number with their corresponding powers of two.
   4.Write down the final value of each power of two.
   5.Add final values

__Binary to Octal Conversion__
1.Write binary number.
2.Multiply each digit by 2n-1.
3.The resultant is the equivalent decimal number for the given binary number.
4.Divide the decimal number by 8.
5.Note down the remainder.

__Binary to Hexa Decimal__
1.Break  the binary number into group with 4 digits 
2.By looking at the conversion table, write the hexadecimal equivalent of each of the groups.
3.Combine all the numbers together to get the hexadecimal number.
