## Introduction
There are different types of Nber systems

1.	Binaryary Nber System
2.	Decimalimal Nber System
3.	Octalal Nber System
4.	Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal Nber System

We have four types of Nber systems so each one can be converted into the remaining three systems. There are the following conversions possible in Nber System
1.	Binaryary  To Other Nber System
2.	Decimalimal To Other Nber System
3.	Octalal To Other Nber System
4.	Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal To Other Nber System

i) BinaryARY TO OTHER NBER SYSTEMS:
•	Binaryary To Decimalimal Nber System
•	Binaryary To Octalal Nber System
•	Binaryary To Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal Nber System

ii) DecimalIMAL TO OTHER NBER SYSTEMS:
•	Decimalimal to Binaryary Nber System
•	Decimalimal to Octalal Nber Systems
•	Decimalimal to Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal Nber System

iii) OctalAL TO OTHER NBER SYSTEMS:
•	Octalal to Binaryary Nber System
•	Octalal to Decimalimal Nber System
•	Octalal to Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal Nber System

iv) Hexa-DecimalA DecimalIMAL NBER SYSTEMS:
•	Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal to Decimalimal Nber System
•	Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal to Binaryary Nber System
•	Hexa-Decimala Decimalimal to Octalal Nber System
