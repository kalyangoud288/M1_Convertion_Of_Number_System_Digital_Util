## Introduction
There are different types of Number systems

1.	Binary Number System
2.	Decimal Number System
3.	Octal Number System
4.	Hexa Decimal Number System

We have four types of number systems so each one can be converted into the remaining three systems. There are the following conversions possible in Number System
1.	Binary  To Other Number System
2.	Decimal To Other Number System
3.	Octal To Other Number System
4.	Hexa Decimal To Other Number System

i) BINARY TO OTHER NUMBER SYSTEMS:
•	Binary To Decimal Number System
•	Binary To Octal Number System
•	Binary To Hexa Decimal Number System

ii) DECIMAL TO OTHER NUMBER SYSTEMS:
•	Decimal to Binary Number System
•	Decimal to Octal Number Systems
•	Decimal to Hexa Decimal Number System

iii) OCTAL TO OTHER NUMBER SYSTEMS:
•	Octal to Binary Number System
•	Octal to Decimal Number System
•	Octal to Hexa Decimal Number System

iv) HEXA DECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEMS:
•	Hexa Decimal to Decimal Number System
•	Hexa Decimal to Binary Number System
•	Hexa Decimal to Octal Number System
